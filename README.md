# FIXE
A web-software that allows you to create vectorial graphics and export them in SVG format.
Inspired by Adobe Illustrator.

## HOW it works:
  - **PRESS [m]**: for choosing the "rect tool"
  - **PRESS [e]**: for choosing the "ellipse tool"
  - **PRESS [+] or [-]** for choosing the scaling


### Development status:
  15 october 2022
  - **RECT TOOL**: allows you to create rects and to view them while mousedown and mousemoving
  - **ELLIPSE TOOL**: allows you to create ellipse and to view them while mousedown and mousemoving
  - **EXPORT**: allows you to export the workspace with all the shapes created in SVG format

### TO IMPLEMENT:
  - **MULTIPLE WORKSPACE**: Add numerous workspaces at the same time and allow the user to choose which one to use and which one to export
  - **SCALING**: Zoom in and zoom out our space consistently
